An Internet Information Services (IIS) worker process is a windows process (w3wp.exe) which runs Web applications, 
and is responsible for handling requests sent to a Web Server for a specific application pool.

The ASP.NET worker process (aspnet_wp.exe or w3wp.exe) runs using an account (ASPNET) with weaker privileges than the Local System account.
